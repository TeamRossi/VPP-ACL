ACL was already implemented in two different released versions of VPP. 
And there are implemented two different packet classification algorithms in these two different version, 
however we decided to use a different algorithm in our contribution:

* Linear search in VPP 17.04
* Tuple Space Search in VPP 17.10
* TupleMerge in our contribution
