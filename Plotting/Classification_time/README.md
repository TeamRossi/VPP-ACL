After the experiment has generated a dataset, with tools in this directory, we can parse and plot results.

First, we have to merge all the data that has generated from the same seed (for each seed there are five different Ruleset). Then we plot the parsed output.

** RAW_DATA

a raw data example is in the directort ` $repository/RAW-DATA `

** script_merge_exp.sh <raw data directory>

` script_merge_exp $repository/RAW-DATA `

** make hist
